  <tr>
    <td>I learnt to make a drop shadow by using a website which name i can't remember. I also learnt how to set an image as my background instead of a boring colour. This was achieved through trial and error. These strategies were both very effective.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>People were being very disruptive throughout the lesson by singing and generally making annoying noises. This limited my working because i couldn't focus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would ask teachers for advice instead of trial and error which is very time consuming.</td>
